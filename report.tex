    This report investigates the use of transition matrices to solve specific recursive relations, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional Dynamic Programming (DP) approaches for certain problems. By deriving the transition matrices and applying fast matrix exponentiation, we aim to reduce computational complexity. We compare the efficiency of these two methods through theoretical analysis and experimental results, examining whether actual computation times align with the predicted complexities. Our findings demonstrate the potential of transition matrices in optimizing the computation of high-order recurrences, particularly for large-scale problems.
